## Introduction
This project aims to segment customers based on various attributes like demographics, purchase history, and behavior patterns using K-Means clustering. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies, products, and services to meet the needs of different groups.

## Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of data-driven marketing and business strategy. By grouping customers with similar characteristics, companies can:
- Improve customer targeting and personalization.
- Optimize marketing campaigns.
- Increase customer satisfaction and retention.

In this project, we perform segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The segments are created based on key features derived from customer data, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Purchase Frequency

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains customer information, including:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: Estimated annual income of the customer in dollars.
- **Spending Score**: A metric that describes the customer's spending habits.
- **Purchase History**: Details of past purchases made by the customer.

The data has been pre-processed to ensure no missing or incorrect values, and normalization is applied to maintain scale consistency across features.

## Methodology
The steps involved in the project are:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key features and relationships through visualization.
3. **Feature Selection**: Choosing the most relevant features for clustering.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
5. **Cluster Evaluation**: Using metrics like the silhouette score and inertia to evaluate the performance of the model.
6. **Visualization**: Representing customer segments visually using 2D/3D plots.

### K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points into distinct clusters based on similarity. The algorithm tries to minimize the within-cluster variance, ensuring that the data points within each cluster are as similar as possible.

## Results
The model was able to segment the customers into distinct groups. Here are some key insights:
- **Cluster 1**: Young high-income individuals with a high spending score.
- **Cluster 2**: Middle-aged customers with moderate income and low spending scores.
- **Cluster 3**: Senior customers with low income and moderate spending habits.
  
The results of the segmentation can be used to tailor marketing strategies for each segment and improve overall customer experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12.0**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for K-Means implementation

## Installation
To get a copy of the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script to perform customer segmentation.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and ready for clustering.
2. Run the K-Means algorithm to generate clusters.
3. Visualize the customer segments.
4. Use the resulting clusters for business decision-making or marketing purposes.

You can modify the clustering parameters like the number of clusters (`k`) and test with different features or clustering techniques.
